SUMMARY: A cell phone text-based app in which various players compete to guess the current temperature in American cities.

PRESENT FUNCTIONALITY: Users can text a city and state to a designated Twilio phone number and the app will then send a message to all participating users asking that they guess the current temperature in that city.  Users then respond to the text message with their guess and the app will inform them if they are correct or, if incorrect, by how much.

FUTURE FEATURES: (i) Develop web interface, including the capability to sign up to play (presently, participating users' phone numbers are hard-coded into app), (2) maintain users' scoreboard, (3) designate the winner as the FIRST person to get the temperature correct.
